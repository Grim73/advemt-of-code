  - Linux command line
    - curl
      - how to get your [cookie session](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1)
      - how to [curl your daily input](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/a2vonl/how_to_download_inputs_with_a_script/) **DO NOT RUN THIS IN A LOOP**
    - git
      - I used [this link](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html) to setup my repo. after running into a few issues, I finally used `git clone` to bring my repo down and copied my prebuilt file structure into the directory
